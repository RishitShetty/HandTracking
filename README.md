# HandTracking
THE SYSTEM UTILIZES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO DETECT AND IDENTIFY HAND GESTURES, ENABLING CONTROL OF APPLIANCES. THE PROTOTYPE DEMONSTRATES THIS FUNCTIONALITY USING LEDS AND A SERVO MOTOR, WITH ARDUINO AS THE CHOSEN PLATFORM.
Al IS TURNING SCIENCE FICTION INTO REALITY, TRANSFORMING VARIOUS INDUSTRIES.

• REAL-TIME HAND LANDMARK DETECTION IS ACHIEVED THROUGH OPENCV AND MEDIAPIPE LIBRARIES.
• MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHMS ANALYZE THE COORDINATES OF HAND LANDMARKS TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF RAISED FINGERS.
ARDUINO, PROGRAMMED WITH PYTHON, PERFORMS SPECIFIC TASKS BASED ON THE RECEIVED INFORMATION, WHICH CAN BE TRANSMITTED VIA THE PYSERIAL LIBRARY.
FOR THE PROTOTYPE VERSION, INBUILT MICROPROCESSOR OF THE LAPTOP AND WEBCAM IS USED FOR REAL-TIME TRACKING AND GESTURE RECOGNITION, WHICH CAN BE REPLACED WITH A RASPBERRY PI AND A WEBCAM
